In OBP we largely define our endpoints using an internal case class or model called ResourceDoc

Using this endpoint, developers can create their own Resource Docs at run time thus creating fully featured 
Open Bank Project style endpoints dynamically.

In order to do this you need to prepare your desired Resource Doc as JSON.
The business logic code can be written in the *method_body* field as encoded Scala code.
  
This feature is somewhat work in progress (WIP).

The following videos are available:
